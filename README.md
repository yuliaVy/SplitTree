## 📖 Overview
**SplitTree** is a web-based classified ads marketplace built using the **ASP.NET MVC** framework. It allows users to register, post advertisements for items they wish to sell, and browse listings from other community members.

This project was developed as a college assignment to demonstrate proficiency in full-stack .NET development, specifically focusing on the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture, **CRUD** operations, and **Relational Database Management**.

## Key Features

### User Features
* **Secure Authentication:** Users can register and log in to access personalized features.
* **Create Listings:** Registered users can post new ads with descriptions and categories.
* **Manage Content:** Users have full control (Edit/Delete) over their own advertisements.
* **Search & Browse:** Anyone can view active ads and filter them by specific categories.

### Admin Features
* **User Management:** Admins can view a list of all registered users.
* **Content Moderation:** Admins have the authority to remove ads that are unsuitable or violate platform rules.

## Technology Stack
* **Framework:** ASP.NET MVC (.NET Framework / Core)
* **Language:** C#
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap
* **Database:** SQL Server (via Entity Framework)
* **Tools:** Visual Studio 2022


## Learning Outcomes
Building this project helped me understand:
* The **MVC Architectural Pattern** (separating logic, data, and UI).
* **Entity Framework** for object-relational mapping (ORM).
* Implementing **Identity/Authentication** in web apps.
* Designing database schemas for users and relational data.
